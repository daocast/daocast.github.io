DAOcast is an attempt at exploring the frontiers of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. It's a series of podcast-style interviews with DAO researchers, developers and enthusiasts. The interviews always keep a casual tone. Free-flowing conversation is our one and only objective.

The 1st season features 10 episodes with the Pollinators, DAOstack's early adopters community. Their backgrounds come from business, developing, non-profit, academia, art and more. We gave them the mic and asked them but a single question:

"Who are you and what does a DAO mean to you?"

## DAOcast's hosts are Danilo and Stratis.

[Danilo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgK8QFYdbNk) is fascinated by everything Complexity related, from fungi mycelium, to cultural evolution, to distributed computer networks. He's worked as a community manager at DAOstack during the project's ICO.

Stratis is a crypto enthusiast since 2015 and currently working as Marketing Manager at DAOstack. Among other things, he's passionate about free thought, free speech and free market.

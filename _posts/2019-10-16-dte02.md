"DAO to Earth" is an inquiry based project that seeks to further understand the experience of participating in a DAO, and how this new framework for organizing relates to the world we‚Äôre currently living in.

It was [funded by the Genesis DAO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ifwyPBI1dwYaCNH2fmF3ptHgb6gohStY_iLx3Rog0XE/edit) through [Alchemy](https://daostack.io/alchemy) ([DAOstack](https://daostack.io/)'s first DAO interface), and it is comprised of 9 interviews with Genesis members. It is hoped that this series will function as a DAO-knowledge library for current builders and future explorers of the dawn of DAOs.

> ‚ÄúIf you think about it, every DAO can be its own bank. Every DAO can behave as a community credit union, or as an insurance collective of some sort.‚Äù

The second episode of the ‚ÄúDAO to Earth‚Äù series is on! This time, we receive Patrick Rawson, DAOstack‚Äôs Communications Director, for a chat about the historical development of DAOstack‚Äôs first DAO, and what is coming next with Genesis 1.0.

We also took a trip down memory lane, remembering some moments we shared during DAOstack‚Äôs early days and, even before that, how Pat ended up in the crypto world.
‚Ä®But the juiciest part of this conversation came when Pat shared with us some of the new things coming up within Genesis. The DAO will now accommodate for different types of organizations (and peers), such as:

            - Maker Orgs (blockchain orgs in the ethereum ecosystem. Ex: DAOstack)
            - Funds (purchasing locked GEN from genesis 1.0 to generate reputation for themselves)
            - Community building orgs
            - Dev/Builders. Ex: dOrg)
            - Traditional orgs (governments, nonprofits, corps)
            - Collectives

It will also hold a locked GEN tokens fund, which organizations will be able to support in exchange for voting rights within Genesis 1.0. And watch out for another big DAO launch in the ecosystem - a decentralized exchange bringing $2.5 Mi to fund a DAO.

That and more in this episode!

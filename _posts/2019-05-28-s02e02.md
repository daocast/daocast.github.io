> “We are really excited to work on it and to see how far we go bringing the commons and the communities’ perspectives into the blockchain arena.” Antorio Tenorio.

As a 5-year EU-sponsored research project, [P2P Models](https://p2pmodels.eu/about/) is producing infrastructure for the collaborative economy using blockchain technology, focusing on mainly two aspects.

- Governance - how decision making, boundaries and conflict resolution are dealt with
- Value Distribution - how value (in its multiple forms) is created, recognized and shared within collaborative communities.

This endeavor is being conducted with a plural perspective, characterized by the team's diversity, as well as a solid social theoretical grounding, that draws from the work of people like Nobel winner Prof. Elinor Ostrom.

In our chat, we went deeper into the project's early development, its infrastructural choices, digital communities' dynamics and much more. Tune in to learn more about this exciting project and the amazing people behind it.

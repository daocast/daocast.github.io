"DAO to Earth" is an inquiry based project that seeks to further understand the experience of participating in a DAO, and how this new framework for organizing relates to the world we‚Äôre currently living in.

It was [funded by the Genesis DAO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ifwyPBI1dwYaCNH2fmF3ptHgb6gohStY_iLx3Rog0XE/edit) through [Alchemy](https://daostack.io/alchemy) ([DAOstack](https://daostack.io/)'s first DAO interface), and it is comprised of 9 interviews with Genesis members. It is hoped that this series will function as a DAO-knowledge library for current builders and future explorers of the dawn of DAOs.

For the first time in DAOcast, we have an episode where guest is host and host is guest. Jordan Ellis, one of the co-founders of [dOrg](https://dorg.tech/#/), kindly agreed to be the host of an episode of the DAO to Earth series and invited his peers to join this experiment. The result? A distributed conversation among dOrg members about the functioning and purpose of this pioneering DAO.

As usual, we covered a lot of ground:

- The inner working of dOrg, which seems to have managed to amazingly balance trust and trustlessness in its internal dynamics.
- The interface between dOrg and other organizations, both legally and culturally speaking.
- How dOrg became the first legal DAO to ever exist, without loosing what makes it decentralized in its essence.
- How to be part of and/or help dOrg grow.
- The next steps for Web3

A juicy episode, that sheds light on many of the subtleties around distributed dynamics, both internally and externally. More importantly, an episode with substantial experiences from pioneers who have made things happen despite challenges.

A big shout out to our host, [Jordan Ellis](https://twitter.com/dOrgJelli). And our guests [Ori Shimony](https://twitter.com/orishim), Hector, and Cesar.

Happy 2020! The year has begun very early for DAOcast!

And to kick things off, we received [Will Harborne](https://twitter.com/will_harborne), founder of [DeversiFi](https://www.deversifi.com/) and one of the initiators of [necDAO](https://nectar.community/dao).

Will 2020 be the year of the DAO? We are about to find out, as we have explored in this episode. Moreover, we had the chance to go over the intricacies DeversiFi and NecDAO, including:

- A bit  on the back story of DeversiFi and its origins with Ethfinex;
- Examples of previous experiments in decentralised technology;
- The why behind NecDAO, itâ€™s purpose, what it is constitutionally designed to achieve and how much funds it will launch with.
- As well as where these funds came from and how NecDAO will work, diving into the technicalities.

So, overall, the conversation was a good start to this year's work, opening up opportunities for the larger community to engage with another resourceful DAO. Tune in for the Nectar and if you have any questions, [let Will know](mailto:will@deversifi.com).

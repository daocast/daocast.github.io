"DAO to Earth" is an inquiry based project that seeks to further understand the experience of participating in a DAO, and how this new framework for organizing relates to the world we‚Äôre currently living in.

It was [funded by the Genesis DAO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ifwyPBI1dwYaCNH2fmF3ptHgb6gohStY_iLx3Rog0XE/edit) through [Alchemy](https://daostack.io/alchemy) ([DAOstack](https://daostack.io/)'s first DAO interface), and it is comprised of 9 interviews with Genesis members. It is hoped that this series will function as a DAO-knowledge library for current builders and future explorers of the dawn of DAOs.

> ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt all break our minds free, this experiment will be like any other one.‚Äù

In this episode of the series, we received Grace Rachmany, whose previous experiences in the field are difficult to summarize: Coauthor of the first leadership handbook specifically for the crypto industry: So You've Got a DAO. Participant in dGov Forum, Genesis DAO (DAOstack). Founder DAOleadership.com, which provides governance consulting for DAOs as well as Leadership Training for DAOs. Founder of IwriteICOwhitepapers.com, which produced more than 100 whitepapers for ICOs and STOs. 30 years in technology industries as a writer, manager, and entrepreneur. Founder / CEO of 3 profitable service businesses in the tech space.

As one can imagine, the conversation with Grace was one of a kind. She gave us the good, the bad, and the ugly of decentralization, with no fear of speaking her truth. For example, one of the key points we touched on was: Who has created the rules of the value games we play nowadays? And why is crypto, which has the potential to change said rules, often being leveraged to enforce the same old dynamics we already know are fragile?

We also talked about our experiences with collaborative dynamics that worked well precisely because there was no incentive other than empathy, and whether or not those can be catalyzed by the emerging technologies of blockchain. And, of course, we dived into projects in the space, such as Holochain and DAOstack.

A treat to any DAO enthusiast.

"DAO to Earth" is an inquiry based project that seeks to further understand the experience of participating in a DAO, and how this new framework for organizing relates to the world we‚Äôre currently living in.

It was [funded by the Genesis DAO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ifwyPBI1dwYaCNH2fmF3ptHgb6gohStY_iLx3Rog0XE/edit) through [Alchemy](https://daostack.io/alchemy) ([DAOstack](https://daostack.io/)'s first DAO interface), and it is comprised of 9 interviews with Genesis members. It is hoped that this series will function as a DAO-knowledge library for current builders and future explorers of the dawn of DAOs.

> ‚ÄúThe key aspect of the protocol is the creation of an entity - or an object - that we call an ‚Äúeve‚Äù, which is an evolving entity.‚Äù

For the third instance of the DAO to Earth series, we receive spaceship developer Pepo Ospina, creator of [Collective One](http://www.collectiveone.org/#/landing) and the [Underscore Protocol](http://www.uprtcl.io/).

As expected, this conversation was nothing short of fly! Pepo walked us through his path towards decentralization, sharing how it derived from frustrations he had with corporate hierarchical structures, alongside his interest in open collaboration. All of which brought his to start working on Collective One, a platform for collaboration whose premise is to let people channel their energy into something with as few barriers as possible.

We then quickly got into the gist of the conversation by exploring the Underscore Protocol, a protocol that allows people to, quite literally, give life to all kinds of digital files so as to ‚Äúbreed‚Äù them in process of creating articles, music, and other types of content.

Sounds crazy, right? Well, listen up and see for yourself!

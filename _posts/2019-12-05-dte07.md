"DAO to Earth" is an inquiry based project that seeks to further understand the experience of participating in a DAO, and how this new framework for organizing relates to the world we‚Äôre currently living in.

It was [funded by the Genesis DAO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ifwyPBI1dwYaCNH2fmF3ptHgb6gohStY_iLx3Rog0XE/edit) through [Alchemy](https://daostack.io/alchemy) ([DAOstack](https://daostack.io/)'s first DAO interface), and it is comprised of 9 interviews with Genesis members. It is hoped that this series will function as a DAO-knowledge library for current builders and future explorers of the dawn of DAOs.

> ‚ÄúFrom my experience with hip hop, it's all about the experience of being there, the vibration of the crowd.‚Äù

One amazing thing about DAOs is that they attract all kinds of curious mind, with very diverse backgrounds and ares of expertise. This episode with Hip Hop artist and cultural producer [Jason Vandal](https://twitter.com/vandigital) is the perfect example of that.

‚ÄúGrowing up in the heart of Chinatown, Downtown Toronto, Jason fell in love with Hip Hop in the 80‚Äôs and would Breakdance on Queen St. for spare change with his childhood friends and was always eager to put on a show.‚Äù (Vandal's Biography)

Since then, life has taken him to live and perform in many places around the world. South East Asia is the bioregion he has been the closest to, choosing Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, as his home.

As a rapper, community builder, and producer, Vandal had many reasons to experiment with decentralized technologies. Steemit was his window into this world, leading up to the project [‚ÄúHip Hop the Blockchain‚Äù](https://steemit.com/@hhtb). From there, Vandal has discovered the world of DAOs and is now in the process of on-boarding into Alchemy and Genesis.

We talked about all of that and more in our chat. With his very unique perspective, Vandal told us abut the parallels between Hip Hop and Blockchain, some of his disillusions with both movements, his experience as a newcomer of the DAO world, and the way he sees [Wu-Tang Clan](https://wutangclan.com/) and [Taoist Wu Wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei) philosophy giving rise to the DAO of Wu.

Indeed, a unique episode!‚Ä®

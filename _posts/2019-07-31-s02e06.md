This episode is a repost from [Emerge](https://anchor.fm/emerge), a podcast based inquiry into the next phase of the human experiment. Its host, Daniel, invited DAOcast to explore all things Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). And the result was nothing sort of amazing.

**From Emerge:**

"We talk about  what DAOs are and why they are significant, where the space is at (and what it’s evolving into), how DAOs might allow for teal/horizontal/distributed organizations to scale, what are some of the most exciting DAOs currently active, the need for wacky proposals, and more.

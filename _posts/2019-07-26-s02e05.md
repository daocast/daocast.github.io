In the first DAOcast episode with [Colony](https://colony.io/), we are joined by Auryn to discuss the public launch of Glider, the project‚Äôs network for decentralized organizations.  first episode with Colony, we are joined by [Auryn](https://twitter.com/auryn_macmillan) to discuss the public launch of [Glider](https://blog.colony.io/glider-has-launched/), the project‚Äôs network for decentralized organizations.

Auryn also shares his [previous experiences with The DAO](https://blog.daohub.org/back-to-our-roots-31a56058ad22), given his engagement with that first decentralized experimentation through the creation of [DAOHub](https://blog.daohub.org/).

Besides exploring Colony style organization structures and incentives, as well as some aspects of the Colony dApp (coming out soon), we had a very insightful thought experiment on how Colony organizations could be synergistically connected, today, to other DAOs running on other ecosystems, such as Aragon and DAOstack.
For all of these reasons, and more, this is definitely an episode worth checking.
